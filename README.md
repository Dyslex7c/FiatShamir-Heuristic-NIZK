# FiatShamir-Heuristic-NIZK

We can develop a Non-Interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof using Fiat-Shamir heuristic and ECC. Let's say Bob is the prover and Alice is the verifier. Bob knows x (assume it to be a private key). Both of them agree upon the values of G and H (points on the elliptic curve) Bob computes xG and xH and sends it to Alice. Bob then selects v and calculates c as the hash of xG, xH, vG, and vH. Bob calculates `r = v-xc` and sends it over to Alice alongside vG and vH. Alice computes c and checks the following:

```
vG == rG + c(xG)
vH == rH + c(xH)
```

If both satisfy, it has been thus proved that Bob knows x

Proof: vG = rG + c(xG) = (v-cx)G + c(xG) = vG (Similarly for vH)
